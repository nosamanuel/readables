A very basic report for your Readability.

* Number of words and articles read over a period of time
* Number of unread word and article counts

### Usage


Create an `auth.py` module with the following definitions:

    API_KEY = '<readability_api_key>'
    API_SECRET = '<readability_api_secret>'
    XAUTH_TOKEN = ('<xauth>', '<tuple>')

Then run `python report.py <archived_since> <archived_until>`.

### Future

* Sparklines
* Caching
* New words encountered
* Top words over a period
* Languages
